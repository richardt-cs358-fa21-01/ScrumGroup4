# Coding Standards
1. The commit and Pull system 

- Need 1 Branch for "every new task' (one per members)
* to create a branch : 
GitHub --> repository --> branch selector dropdown --> Create Branch

- Clone this Branch in Vs Studio 
Copy the code of the branch --> open Vs Studio --> Source Control --> Clone a repository.

- Pull request 
At least one member of the need need to comfirm the request
if appoval, go and merge.


2. Indenting and Line Length
Use an indent of 4 spaces and don't use any tab because different computers use different setting for tab. It is recommended to keep lines at approximately 75-85 characters long for better code readability.

3. Control Structures
 if, for, while, switch, etc. Control statements should have one space between the control keyword and opening parenthesis, to distinguish them from function calls. You are strongly encouraged to always use curly braces even in situations where they are technically optional.

4. Function Calls
Functions should be called with no spaces between the function name, the opening parenthesis, and the first parameter; spaces between commas and each parameter, and no space between the last parameter, the closing parenthesis, and the semicolon.

5. Comments & Php code style 
C style comments (/* */) and standard C++ comments (//) are both fine. Use of Perl/shell style comments (#) is discouraged. Always use <?php ?> to delimit PHP code, not the <? ?> shorthand. This is required for PHP compliance and is also the most portable way to include PHP code on differing operating systems and setups.

6. Variable Names
Use all lower case letters
Use '_' as the word separator.
Global variables should be prepended with a 'g'.
Global constants should be all caps with '_' separators.
Static variables may be prepended with 's'.

7. One Statement Per Line/Short Methods or Functions
Methods should limit themselves to a single page of code. There should be only one statement per line unless the statements are very closely related.
